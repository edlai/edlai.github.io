# Welcome to Ed's Personal Wiki

I always like to see how it works on my hands after I studied some knowledge from books or from Internet. On the other hand, I was not an outstanding student who excelled academically at school. This is why I have to write some codes or solder circuit to do something to make sure that it happens like what I thought. Some of them are my homeworks when I was a student at school and some of them are my studies in my spare time. (Updated: 2021/07/03)

## Introduction

There are several sections of this Wiki.

### [Engineering](distro/debian/index.md)
There are some of my reports and homeworks when I was a BSEE undergraduate student in university or in my career.

### [Education](qualitative-research/index.md)
 
There are some of the reports and homeworks when I was a MSMIE graduate student. But it's still under construction now. 

### [Collection](collections/index.md)

My collection from Internet. Something like how to write your CV using TEX files (LaTeX), how to capture wireless packets from Wireshark and so on.

### [Motivation](painting/index.md)

Motivations for my life and career.
