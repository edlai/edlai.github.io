# A WAP Phone Emulator

## Purpose

A ZIP-file containing all the code for the WAP phone emulator can be downloaded from the EE212 web pages. This application has two purposes:

  - To give you an example of a larger Tcl application which incorporates most of the Tcl tk features which have been presented in the EE212 course (including Tcl networking, packages, regexps and Tk widgets). Chris Cracknell, who wrote this application, will present a walk-through of the code during a support class for the assignment on Tuesday, 20 November, 10.00-12.00 in 4s.6.28.
  - To provide a further opportunity in Graphical User Interface design, for the constrained environment of a WAP-phone display and interface. WAP phones have limited display and input capabilities, typically consisting of a small display of e.g. 4-line x 20 characters, and a few buttons, possibly augmented by a jog-dial or other navigation control. As a mass-market product, they are also intended to be intuitive and natural to use - a difficult objective to achieve! Use your initiative and any of the tools covered in the course to design an improved WAP phone interface. For example you could add extra control/navigation buttons, design new bespoke buttons from scratch by overlaying images/bitmaps on standard buttons, investigate the use of a larger display, model a solution on some of the recently introduced combined PDA/WAP phones, etc..... (but I don't advise trying to do all of these!). A limited solution could simply simulate your GUI design ideas; a full solution will link your improved GUI to the code supplied to provide a full WAP emulator.

Submit code and screendumps of any solution which you produce, together with a brief explanation of your design objectives and how you attempted to achieve them. Marks will be awarded for effort and for achievement.
